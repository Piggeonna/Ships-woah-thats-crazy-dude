Ships! Read pls /nf

Ships are on a 0-10 scale. Anything marled with an asterix (*) interact with caution, and double asterix (**) DNI. Of course friends change this and can ignore this, but just something to keep in mind.

Sonally 5.4/10 i think this is the only (or one of few) technically canon ships, but i don't really see it at all

Sonamy 4.6/10 i think this is a cuteish ship, but i personally think sonic is too focused on saving the world to have a crush on amy. one sided sonamy is cute so long as liking sonic isn't her whole personality.

(**) Sonangle 2.3/10 i dislike this ship a lot. they don't jave any sort of romance in their relationship, and are simply battle buddies and good friends.

(*) Sonave 1.3/10 their personalties are so different from each other that this would never work. wave cheats, lies, and is rude, while sonic is the exact opposite.
